# Open-Source University

An attempt to catalog all of the software systems used within higher education
and identify whether or not you can find free, open-source alternatives for
each system.

This project is currently focusing on universities within the United States.

## Accounting System
System for managing and auditing the financial transactions within a
university.

## Alumni Management System
System for keeping track of alumni, generally for fundraising efforts.

(None Available)

## Calendaring System
System for displaying campus events in a calendar format.

This isn't really a higher education-specific problem: many universities simply
use Google Calendar. For an open-source alternative, institutions could use an
open-source DAV server, like [Baikal](http://sabre.io/baikal/), with an
open-source DAV client, like [AgenDAV](http://agendav.org/).

The assumption is that there are a number of open-source solutions to this
problem, so they won't be listed here.

## Career Services System
System for managing all aspects of student career services, including
event management for career fairs, coordinating on-campus interviews, and
providing a student job search platform.

(None Available)

## Customer Relationship Management
System for managing and tracking a university's interactions with its
"customers", which often refers to students, but could also include alumni,
staff, and more.

(None Available)

Although I could not find any open-source CRM solutions _specific_ to
higher education, there are plenty of general open-source CRM solutions that
could likely be tweaked to fit the needs of a higher education institution.

## Document Management System
System used to scan, index, and archive images of university documents.

(None Available)

## E-mail System
System supporting university e-mail communication.

Similar to a calendaring system (see above), this is not a higher education-specific
problem. There are a number of open-source solutions to this problem, so they
will not be listed here.

## Emergency Communication System
System for notifying people across the university of an emergency situation,
like an active shooter or gas leak. Methods of communication could include
phone, text message, e-mail, and more.

(None Available)

## Enterprise Resource Planning

TBD

## Event Management System

## Financial Aid Management System
